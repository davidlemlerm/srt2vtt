# srt2vtt

A simple Python program to convert srt (SubRip Subtitle) caption files to vtt (WebVTT) caption files.

I haven't thoroughly tested it, and just created it for my own use and have it here so others may benefit from it.  Since it hasn't been throughly tested, don't use it for anything critical without first manually checking the output file to make sure that it's formatted correctly.
